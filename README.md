 This was part of a personal finance web application project called 
 "Checkbook" (later "Balances").  The code samples are pieces of the feature known as AutoPilot.  AutoPilot was operated as a command-line service written in PHP that would go out and download new transactions from a person's bank account and add them to the Checkbook application.  If the service found new transactions, it would send a message to the user by e-mail or by push notification on an Apple iOS device.
